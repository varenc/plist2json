# This script converts a plist file to JSON. Either xml or binary plists are supported
# It can take a file over STDIN or as the first argument
# It's key improvement over the built-in `plutil -convert json` is that it can handle plists with binary data.
# ÌŒBinary values are just converted to strings with `str()` and appear in the JSON output as `"b\"\\x00\\x10\\xfa\\xff\\x00...\""`

# Example usage:
# $ plist2json.py /path/to/file.plist | jq 
# $ cat /path/to/file.plist | plist2json.py | jq
